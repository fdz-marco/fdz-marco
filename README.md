- 👋 Hi, I’m @fdz-marco.
- 🤓 I studied BEng. Mechatronics Engineering and a MSc. Production Systems Engineering.
- 💕 My true passions are programming, developing and research.
- 😄 I'm a "Random Stack Developer", I just like programming 🧙‍♂️.
  - 😄 I program in C#, Python, Java, Web (HTML + CSS + JS), and PHP.
  - 😄 I program in ST, LD, FDB, SFC and SCL (Beckhoff, Allen-Bradley and Siemens).
  - 😄 I program in arduino IDE, asm (basic μC), MPLAB IDE, Atmel Studio.
- 💻 Learning Go and Rust.
- ❤️ I like astronomy, photography and drawing.
- ⚡ Fun fact (1): I started to program when I have 8yo in QBasic (too complicated for me), then I learned Visual Basic 6 and then Game Maker Language, because all that I wanted as kid was to create my own videogame.
- ⚡ Fun fact (2): Open a console and enter the command "curl marcofdz.com" 🦆.
