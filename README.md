- 👋 Hi, I’m @fdz-marco.
- 😄 I'm a "Random Stack Developer", I just like programming 🧙‍♂️
  - 😄 I program in C#, Python, Java, Web (HTML + CSS + JS), and PHP.
  - 😄 I program in ST, LD, FDB, SFC and SCL (Beckhoff, Allen-Bradley and Siemens)
  - 😄 I program in arduino IDE, asm (basic μC), MPLAB IDE, Atmel Studio
- ❤️ I like astronomy, photography and drawing
- ⚡ Fun fact (1): I started to program when I have 8yo in QBasic (too complicated for me), then I learned VisualBasic6 and then Game Maker Language.
- ⚡ Fun fact (2): Open a console and enter the command "curl marcofdz.com" 🦆
